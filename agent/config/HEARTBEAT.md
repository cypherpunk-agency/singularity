# Heartbeat Instructions

This is a scheduled heartbeat run. Focus on autonomous task management.

## Tasks:
- check @app/agent/CONTINUATION.md for what is currently going on
- check @app/agent/TASKS.md for pending tasks
- process all tasks
- at the end of the run:
  - update @app/agent/CONTINUATION.md with how you want to continue next time
  - keep CONTINUATION.md as short as possible - it should only feed relevant context into the next run
  - reference other files instead of writing things out

## Notes:
- Chat messages are now handled separately via the chat context
- This heartbeat is for autonomous work, not responding to messages
- If you need to communicate something important, update MEMORY.md
