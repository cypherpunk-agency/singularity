- the repo is also mounted in the container,
  - develop locally
  - build in the container (local builds won't be served - the container serves its own dist/)
  - restart container if control-plane code changed, or just rebuild UI if only frontend changed
  - in most cases we don't need to rebuild the image
- always use `-u agent` when running `docker exec` to avoid creating root-owned files in the mounted volume (e.g., `docker exec -u agent singularity-agent npm run build`)
- don't use --no-cache for docker build unless the user allows it
