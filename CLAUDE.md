- read @README.md
- read @agent/config/SOUL.md
- the repo is also mounted in the container, so in most cases we don't need to rebuild the image
- always use `-u agent` when running `docker exec` to avoid creating root-owned files in the mounted volume (e.g., `docker exec -u agent singularity-agent npm run build`)
- don't use --no-cache for docker build unless the user allows it
